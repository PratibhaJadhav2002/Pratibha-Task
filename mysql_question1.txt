1. Indexing & Query Optimization
You have a table with millions of records, and the following query is running very slowly:
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```

ANSWER

1.Adding an index on status and created_at significantly improves performance:

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_created ON orders (status, created_at DESC);

2.Fetch Only Required Columns
Instead of SELECT *, specify only the necessary fields:

3.Optimized Query
SELECT id, customer_id, created_at 
FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'pending' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 50;
